Red is a networking library for Roblox that is simple, fast, and powerful. It is designed with performance and ease of use in mind.

## Features

- **Red is a networking library.** It doesn't force you into using some structure or pattern with it.

- **Red is fast.** It uses the same methods as BridgeNet to reduce bandwidth usage.

- **Red is functional.** The only objects that Red uses are namespaces, everything else is as function as can be.

- **Red is typed.** Red is fully typed in luau, so you can get full intellisense support in your IDE.
