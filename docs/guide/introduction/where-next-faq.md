# Where Next & FAQ

Red has many components and features that you can learn about. They're all quite simple and self explanitory, but it's worth taking a look at the documentation to get a feel for Red.

## I'm new to Red, where should I start

If you're new to Red, you should start with the main feature, networking. Take a look at the namespaces category, starting with [What is a Namespace?](../namespaces/what-is-namespace).

A good place to look at after that would be the examples section.
